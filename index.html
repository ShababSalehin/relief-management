                    <p>Without quality education, children face considerable barriers to employment and earning
                        potential
                        later in life. They are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and less likely to
                        participate
                        in decisions that affect them-threatening their ability to shape a better future for themselves

                        their societies.</p>
